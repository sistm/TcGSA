\arguments{
\item{x}{an object of class'\code{TcGSA}'.}

\item{threshold}{the threshold at which the FDR or the FWER should be
controlled.}

\item{myproc}{a vector of character strings containing the names of the
multiple testing procedures for which adjusted p-values are to be computed.
This vector should include any of the following: "\code{Bonferroni}",
"\code{Holm}", "\code{Hochberg}", "\code{SidakSS}", "\code{SidakSD}",
"\code{BH}", "\code{BY}", "\code{ABH}", "\code{TSBH}" or "\code{none}".
"\code{none}" indicates no adjustement for multiple testing. See
\code{\link[multtest:mt.rawp2adjp]{mt.rawp2adjp}} for details.  Default is
"\code{BY}", the Benjamini & Yekutieli (2001) step-up FDR-controlling
procedure (general dependency structures).  In order to control the FWER(in
case of an analysis that is more a hypothesis confirmation than an
exploration of the expression data), we recommand to use "\code{Holm}", the
Holm (1979) step-down adjusted p-values for strong control of the FWER.}

\item{nbsimu_pval}{the number of observations under the null distribution to
be generated in order to compute the p-values. Default is \code{1e+06}.}

\item{expr}{either a matrix or dataframe of gene expression upon which
dynamics are to be calculated, or a list of gene sets estimation of gene
expression.  In the case of a matrix or dataframe, its dimension are \eqn{n}
x \eqn{p}, with the \eqn{p} sample in column and the \eqn{n} genes in row.
In the case of a list, its length should correspond to the number of gene
sets under scrutiny and each element should be an 3 dimension array of
estimated gene expression, such as for the list returned in the
\code{'Estimations'} element of \code{\link{TcGSA.LR}}.  See details.}

\item{Subject_ID}{a factor of length \eqn{p} that is in the same order as the
columns of \code{expr} (when it is a dataframe) and that contains the patient
identifier of each sample. Ignored if \code{expr} is a list of estimations.}

\item{TimePoint}{a numeric vector or a factor of length \eqn{p} that is in
the same order as \code{Subject_ID} and the columns of \code{expr} (when it
is a dataframe), and that contains the time points at which gene expression
was measured. Ignored if \code{expr} is a list of estimations.}

\item{baseline}{a character string which is the value of \code{TimePoint}
used as baseline.  See Details.}

\item{only.signif}{logical flag for plotting only the significant gene sets.
If \code{FALSE}, all the gene sets from the \bold{gmt} object contained in
\code{x} are plotted.  Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{group.var}{in the case of several treatment` groups, this is a factor of
length \eqn{p} that is in the same order as \code{Timepoint},
\code{Subject_ID}, \code{sample_name} and the columns of \code{expr}.  It
indicates to which treatment group each sample belongs to.  Default is
\code{NULL}, which means that there is only one treatment group.  See
Details.}

\item{Group_ID_paired}{a character vector of length \eqn{p} that is in the
same order as \code{Timepoint}, \code{Subject_ID}, \code{sample_name},
\code{group.var} and the columns of \code{expr}.  This argument must not be
\code{NULL} in the case of a paired analysis, and must be \code{NULL}
otherwise.  Default is \code{NULL}.  See Details.}

\item{ref}{the group which is used as reference in the case of several
treatment groups.  Default is \code{NULL}, which means that reference is the
first group in alphabetical order of the labels of \code{group.var}.  See
Details.}

\item{group_of_interest}{the group of interest, for which dynamics are to be
computed in the case of several treatment groups.  Default is \code{NULL},
which means that group of interest is the second group in alphabetical order
of the labels of \code{group.var}.  See Details.%% ~~Describe
\code{group_of_interest} here~~}

\item{ranking}{a logical flag. If \code{TRUE}, the gene set trends are not hierarchicaly classified, but
ordered by decreasing Likelihood ratios. Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{FUNcluster}{the clustering function used to agglomerate genes in
trends.  Default is \code{NULL}, in which a hierachical clustering is
performed via the function \code{\link[cluster:agnes]{agnes}}, using the
metric \code{clustering_metric} and the method \code{clustering_method}.  See
\code{\link[cluster:clusGap]{clusGap}}}

\item{clustering_metric}{character string specifying the metric to be used
for calculating dissimilarities between observations in the hierarchical
clustering when \code{FUNcluster} is \code{NULL}.  The currently available
options are \code{"euclidean"} and \code{"manhattan"}.  Default is
\code{"euclidean"}.  See \code{\link[cluster:agnes]{agnes}}.  Also, a \code{"sts"} option
is available in TcGSA.  It implements the 'Short Time Series' distance
[Moller-Levet et al., Fuzzy CLustering of short time series and unevenly distributed
sampling points, \emph{Advances in Intelligent Data Analysis V}:330-340 Springer, 2003]
designed specifically for clustering time series.}

}
\value{
An object of class \bold{\link{hclust}} which describes the tree
produced by the clustering process.  The object is a list with components:
\itemize{
\item \code{merge} an \eqn{n-1} by \eqn{2} matrix.  Row \eqn{i} of
\code{merge} describes the merging of clusters at step i of the clustering.
If an element \eqn{j} in the row is negative, then observation -\eqn{j} was
merged at this stage.  If \eqn{j} is positive then the merge was with the
cluster formed at the (earlier) stage \eqn{j} of the algorithm.  Thus
negative entries in merge indicate agglomerations of singletons, and positive
entries indicate agglomerations of non-singletons.
\item \code{height} a set of \eqn{n-1} real values (non-decreasing for
ultrametric trees).  The clustering height: that is, the value of the
criterion associated with the Ward clustering method.
\item \code{order} a vector giving the permutation of the original
observations suitable for plotting, in the sense that a cluster plot using
this ordering and matrix merge will not have crossings of the branches.
\item \code{labels} the gene set trends name.
\item \code{call} the call which produced the result clustering:
\cr\code{hclust(d = dist(map2heat, method = "euclidean"), method = "ward.D2")}
\item \code{method} "ward.D2", as it is the clustering method that has been used
for clustering the gene set trends.
\item \code{dist.method} "euclidean", as it is the distance that has been used
for clustering the gene set trends.
\item \code{legend.breaks} a numeric vector giving the splitting points used
for coloring the heatmap.  If \code{plot} is \code{FALSE}, then it is
\code{NULL}.
\item \code{myclusters} a character vector of colors for the dynamic clusters
of the represented gene set trends, with as many levels as the value of
\code{N_clusters}.  If no dynamic clusters were represented, than this is
\code{NULL}.
\item \code{ddr} a \bold{dendrogram} object with the reordering used for the
heatmap.  See \code{\link{heatmap.2}}.
\item geneset.names character vector with the names of the gene sets
used in the heatmap.
\item \code{clust.trends} a \bold{\link{ClusteredTrends}} object.
\item \code{clustersExport} a data frame with 2 variables containing the two
following variables : \itemize{ \item \code{GeneSet}: the gene set trends
clustered.  \item \code{Cluster}: the dynamic cluster they belong to.  } The
data frame is order by the variable \code{Cluster}.
\item \code{data_plotted}: the data matrix represented by the heatmap
}
}
\description{
This function plots a gene sets dynamic trends heatmap.
}
\details{
On the heatmap, each line corresponds to a gene set, and each column to a
timepoint.

If \code{expr} is a matrix or a dataframe, then the "original" data are
plotted.  On the other hand, if \code{expr} is a list returned in the
\code{'Estimations'} element of \code{\link{TcGSA.LR}}, then it is those
"estimations" made by the \code{\link{TcGSA.LR}} function that are plotted.

If \code{descript} is \code{FALSE}, the second element of \code{margins} can
be reduced (for instance use \code{margins = c(5, 10)}), as there is not so
much need for space in order to display only the gene set names, without
their description.

If there is a large number of significant gene sets, the hierarchical clustering
step repeated for each of them can take a few minutes. To speed things up
(especially) when playing with the ploting parameters for having a nice plot,
one can run the \code{clustTrend} function beforehand, and plug its results
in the \code{plot.TcGSA} function via the \code{clust_trends} argument.
