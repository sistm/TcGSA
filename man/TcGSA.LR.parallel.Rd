}
\arguments{
\item{Ncpus}{The number of processors available on the cluster.}

\item{type_connec}{The type of connection between the processors. Supported
cluster types are \code{"SOCK"}, \code{"PVM"}, \code{"MPI"}, and
\code{"NWS"}. See also \code{\link[parallel:makeCluster]{makeCluster}}.}

\item{expr}{a matrix or dataframe of gene expression.  Its dimension are
\eqn{n}x\eqn{p}, with the \eqn{p} samples in column and the \eqn{n} genes in
row.}

\item{gmt}{a \bold{gmt} object containing the gene sets definition.  See
\code{\link[GSA:GSA.read.gmt]{GSA.read.gmt}} and definition on
\href{http://www.broadinstitute.org/cancer/software/gsea/wiki/index.php/Data_formats}{www.broadinstitute.org}.}

\item{design}{a matrix or dataframe containing the experimental variables that used in the model,
namely \code{subject_name}, \code{time_name}, and \code{covariates_fixed}
and \code{time_covariates} if applicable.  Its dimension are \eqn{p}x\eqn{m}
and its row are is in the same order as the columns of \code{expr}.}

\item{subject_name}{the name of the factor variable from \code{design} that contains the information on
the repetition units used in the mixed model, such as the patient identifiers for instance.
Default is \code{'Patient_ID'}.  See Details.}

\item{time_name}{the name of the numeric or factor variable from \code{design} contains
the information on the time replicates (the time points at which gene
expression was measured).  Default is \code{'TimePoint'}.  See Details.}

\item{crossedRandom}{logical flag indicating wether the random effects of the subjects and of the time points
should be modeled as one crossed random effect or as two separated random effects.
Default is \code{FALSE}. See details.}

\item{covariates_fixed}{a character vector with the names of numeric or factor variables from the \code{design}
matrix that should appear as fixed effects in the model.  See details.
Default is \code{""}, which corresponds to no covariates in the model.}

\item{time_covariates}{the name of a numeric variable from \code{design} that contains
the information on the time replicates (the time points at which gene
expression was measured).  Default is \code{'TimePoint'}.  See Details.}

\item{time_func}{the form of the time trend. Can be either one of \code{"linear"},
\code{"cubic"}, \code{"splines"} or specified by the user, or the column name of
a factor variable from \code{design}. If specified by the user,
it must be as an expression using only names of variables from the \code{design} matrix
with only the three following operators: \code{+}, \code{*}, \code{/} .
The \code{"splines"} form corresponds to the natural cubic B-splines
(see also \code{\link[splines:ns]{ns}}).  If there are only a few timepoints,
a \code{"linear"} form should be sufficient. Otherwise, the \code{"cubic"} form is
more parsimonious than the \code{"splines"} form, and should be sufficiently flexible.
If the column name of a factor variable from \code{design} is supplied,
then time is considered as discrete in the analysis.
If the user specify a formula using column names from design, both factor and numeric
variables can be used.}

\item{minGSsize}{the minimum number of genes in a gene set.  If there are
less genes than this number in one of the gene sets under scrutinity, the
Likelihood Ratio of this gene set is not computed (the mixed model are not
fitted). Default is \code{10} genes as the minimum.}

\item{maxGSsize}{the maximum number of genes in a gene set.  If there are
more genes than this number in one of the gene sets under scrutinity, the
Likelihood Ratio of this gene set is not computed (the mixed model are not
fitted).  This is to avoid very long computation times.  Default is
\code{500} genes as the maximum.}

\item{group_name}{in the case of several treatment groups, the name of a factor variable
from the \code{design} matrix.  It indicates to which treatment group each sample
belongs to.  Default is \code{""}, which means that there is only one
treatment group.  See Details.}

\item{separateSubjects}{logical flag indicating that the analysis identifies
gene sets that discriminates patients rather than gene sets than have a
significant trend over time.  Default is \code{FALSE}.  See Details.}

\item{monitorfile}{a writable \link{connections} or a character string naming a file to write into,
to monitor the progress of the analysis.
Default is \code{""} which is no monitoring.  See Details.}
}
\value{
\code{TcGSA.LR} returns a \code{tcgsa} object, which is a list with
the 5 following elements:
\itemize{
\item fit a data frame that contains the 3 following variables:
\itemize{
\item \code{LR}: the likelihood ratio between the model under the
null hypothesis and the model under the alternative hypothesis.
\item
\code{CVG_H0}: convergence status of the model under the null hypothesis.
\item \code{CVG_H1}: convergence status of the model under the alternative
hypothesis.
}
\item \code{time_func}: a character string passing along the value of the
\code{time_func} argument used in the call.
\item \code{GeneSets_gmt}: a \code{gmt} object passing along the value of the
\code{gmt} argument used in the call.
\item \code{group.var}: a factor passing along the \code{group_name} variable
from the \code{design} matrix.
\item \code{separateSubjects}: a logical flag passing along the value of the
\code{separateSubjects} argument used in the call.
\item \code{Estimations}: a list of 3 dimensions arrays.  Each element of the
list (i.e. each array) corresponds to the estimations of gene expression
dynamics for each of the gene sets under scrutiny (obtained from mixed
models).  The first dimension of those arrays is the genes included in the
concerned gene set, the second dimension is the \code{Patient_ID}, and the
third dimension is the \code{TimePoint}.  The values inside those arrays are
estimated gene expressions.
\item \code{time_DF}: the degree of freedom of the natural splines functions
}
}
\description{
A parallel version of the function \code{\link{TcGSA.LR}} to be used on a
cluster of computing processors.  This function computes the Likelihood
Ratios for the gene sets under scrutiny, as well as estimations of genes
dynamics inside those gene sets through mixed models.
}
\details{
This Time-course Gene Set Analysis aims at identifying gene sets that are not
stable over time, either homogeneously or heterogeneously (see \emph{Hejblum
et al, 2012}) in terms of their probes.  And when the argument
\code{separatePatients} is \code{TRUE}, instead of identifying gene sets that
have a significant trend over time (possibly with probes heterogeneity of
this trend), \emph{TcGSA} identifies gene sets that have significantly
different trends over time depending on the patient.

If the \code{monitorfile} argument is a character string naming a file to
write into, in the case of a new file that does not exist yet, such a new
file will be created. A line is written each time one of the gene sets under
scrutiny has been analysed (i.e. the two mixed models have been fitted, see
\code{\link{TcGSA.LR}}) by one of the parallelized processors.
